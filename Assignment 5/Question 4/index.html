        <mark>Artificial Intelligence</mark> (AI) continues to shape the modern
        world, influencing industries from healthcare to entertainment. Its
        rapid growth has created opportunities once thought impossible, while
        also sparking debates about ethics and the future of human labor.

      <p>
        Over the past decade, advancements in <mark>machine learning</mark> and
        deep neural networks have led to breakthroughs in speech recognition,
        image processing, and autonomous vehicles. Today, AI systems are capable
        of performing complex tasks with incredible precision and speed.

      <p>
        One of the most significant areas of development lies in
        <mark>natural language processing</mark>. AI models can now generate
        human-like text, assist in customer service, and even create original
        content. This revolution has transformed the way businesses and
        individuals interact with technology.

        However, with innovation comes responsibility. Issues of data privacy,
        bias, and accountability are at the forefront of AI ethics. Companies
        and governments must work together to establish frameworks that ensure
        fairness, transparency, and respect for human rights.

      <p>
        Looking ahead, experts predict that AI will continue to evolve,
        integrating seamlessly into daily life. From <mark>smart cities</mark> to
        personalized education and healthcare, the potential applications are
        limitless. The challenge lies in balancing technological progress with
        societal well-being.
